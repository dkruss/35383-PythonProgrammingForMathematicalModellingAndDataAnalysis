      "This project seeks to look at the nature of languages and the changes that occur through time. In  <a href=\"http://youtu.be/a5mZ0R3h8m0\">this video</a>, Dr. John McWhorter discusses features of languages, and briefly mentions the divergence a language (such as Latin) undergoes in different areas over time. English, being a Germanic language, shares similarities with other Germanic languages such as German (Deutsch) and Dutch (Nederlands). Dutch is geographically situated between Germany and England, and as a result the language is in some sense halfway between the two. Other languages such as Afrikaans arose as a result of colonisation, and developed differently over time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Through the analysis of the letter frequency of different languages, this project aims to take a look at the similarities and differences between related languages, specifically looking at Germanic languages and subsets thereof. It will do so both graphically and numerically, and reasoning will be given to account for some of the differences present.\n",

An issue with trying to analyse a language from a text is trying to find texts which represent the language - if we used the novel <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadsby_(novel)\"><em>Gadsby</em></a>, for example, there would be a noticeable absence of the letter 'e'.

      "<u>Challenges:</u>\n",
      "\n",
      "- Unicode.\n",
      "- Trying to generalise functions (such as `letterPlot` and `textClean`) instead of hardcoding them was challenging, but worth the effort, and it certainly makes the notebook a lot tidier than it would otherwise be. For `letterPlot`, there was a lot of trial and error to find the right parameters to make it work. With `textClean`, I was hesitant at first because I wasn't sure how to pass a variable to make a filepath. Of course, Python is beautiful in its simplicity and lets me just do it intuitively; there was no need for me to overcomplicate things.\n",
      "- Unicode.\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>Techniques & references:</u>\n",
      "\n",
      "- A lot of the string operations we did early on in the course were useful - in fact, it was after doing one of the strings assignments we had for homework that I stopped and thought, \"I wonder if I can get a nice little graph of the letter frequency of this...\"\n",
      "- The lesson on unicode proved to be quite useful - there was a lot of consulting that notebook, python documentation  and stackoverflow in order to figure out how to get the unicode to work.\n",
      "- Matplotlib - for my `letterPlot`, I adapted <a href=\"http://matplotlib.org/examples/api/barchart_demo.html\">this example</a> from the matplotlib website, and played around with different things to get it to do what I wanted.\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>Assessment of outcome:</u>\n",
      "\n",
      "- I believe I've successfully achieved the goals that I set - the graphs certainly displayed any prominent differences and similarities, and a few of these were certainly able to be accounted for; perhaps somebody studying linguistics would be able to further explain some more of these.\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>New insights:</u>\n",
      "\n",
      "- When I first began, I wasn't certain about the extent to which I'd be able to extract meaningful data to be analysed, in terms of applying these mathematical methods to different groups of languages. However, I was pleasantly surprised to see that such methods worked reasonably well, and as has been seen, insights can be gathered from these.\n",
      "- It would appear that the `distance` function works reasonably well in measuring how close languages are, up to a point; distances of above ~0.1 started to give less information about relatedness, and it would be interesting to see how this plays out between wider language families.\n",
      "- The letter E is the most used letter not just in English, but in most of the Germanic languages, often by a significant margin.\n",
      "\n",
      "<u>Improvements or Extensions:</u>\n",
      "\n",
      "- This project could easily be adapted to other language families, such as the Romance or Slavic languages, as well as more in-depth looks at different time periods for a specific language. Other extensions could include a look at regional dialects of a language, such as comparing American English to Australian English and English proper.\n",
      "- Related to the above point: a meta-project could compare high-level language families with each other, e.g. comparing Germanic to Italic to Celtic, and so forth.\n",
      "- The scope of this project was relatively small - I only used 1 text for most of the languages, and it would definitely be better to have a broader range of texts.\n",
      "- Another extension would be to compare specific letters or even letter combinations, such as looking solely at vowel distribution, or comparing digraphs such as 'TH', etc. across the different languages."
